# Necib Luxe Wash: Investor and Stakeholder Presentation for Self-Service Laundries in Algerian University Dormitories

## Executive Summary
**Necib Luxe Wash**, a visionary project by Necib Nexus, aims to revolutionize laundry services for Algerian university students by installing state-of-the-art self-service laundries in 10 university dormitories. Spearheaded by Tahar Necib, CEO of Necib Nexus, this initiative addresses the critical lack of modern, affordable laundry facilities in dormitories, where students rely on time-consuming manual washing or expensive off-campus services (200-300 DZD per load).  

Key Highlights:  
- **Market Opportunity**: With a projected student population of 1.874 million by 2025, including over 600,000 dormitory residents, the demand for affordable laundry solutions is significant.  
- **Financial Viability**: An initial investment of 260,000 EUR for 10 sites will generate monthly revenues of 1,125 EUR per site, with a return on investment (ROI) in approximately 2.6 years.  
- **Social Impact**: Enhances student quality of life and modernizes university infrastructure.  
- **Strategic Partnerships**: Proposing collaboration with Condor Electronics for equipment supply and the Algerian Ministry of Higher Education for institutional support.  
- **Alignment with National Goals**: Supports Algeria’s startup ecosystem through Decree Executive 20-254, offering access to fiscal incentives and funding.  

This presentation outlines the project’s value proposition, market analysis, financial projections, and strategic plan to secure investment and partnerships for rapid implementation.

## Market Analysis
### Industry Context
The global self-service laundry market is growing, particularly in high-density settings like university campuses. In Algeria, this sector is underdeveloped, presenting a first-mover opportunity. Students, a key demographic, demand convenient and budget-friendly services to manage daily needs.

### Target Market
- **Student Population**: Projected to reach 1.874 million by 2025, with a 5% annual growth rate from 1.5 million in 2020 ([Statista](https://www.statista.com/statistics/1319896/number-of-students-enrolled-in-tertiary-education-in-algeria/)).  
- **Dormitory Residents**: Over 600,000 students live in university dormitories, with 300-500 students per residence, totaling 3,000-5,000 potential users across 10 targeted sites ([Al-Fanar Media](https://www.al-fanarmedia.org/2021/03/students-death-in-fire-prompts-protests-over-algerias-neglected-dormitories/)).  
- **Demographics**: Primarily 18-25 years old, with an average monthly discretionary spending of 3,000 DZD (20 EUR).  
- **Geographic Focus**: 70% of students are concentrated in urban centers like Algiers, Oran, and Constantine ([Algerian Ministry of Higher Education](https://www.mesrs.dz/index.php/en/2023/05/)).

### Customer Needs
- **Laundry Habits**: Students perform 1-2 laundry sessions weekly, averaging 6 loads per month.  
- **Current Challenges**:  
  - Manual washing is time-consuming and labor-intensive.  
  - Off-campus laundries charge 200-300 DZD per load, with limited hours and outdated equipment.  
  - Only 20% of dormitory residents own washing machines, compared to 60% of households nationwide ([Algerian National Office of Statistics](https://www.ceicdata.com/en/algeria/education-statistics)).  
- **Demand**: A hypothetical survey of 500 students indicates 80% dissatisfaction with current options and strong interest in on-site self-service laundries.

### Competitive Landscape
- **Direct Competitors**: Off-campus laundries with high prices, limited hours, and outdated equipment.  
- **Indirect Competitors**: Manual washing services, charging ~200 DZD per load, requiring significant effort.  
- **Necib Luxe Wash Advantages**:  
  - On-site accessibility within dormitories.  
  - Affordable pricing at 75 DZD per wash.  
  - 24/7 availability.
