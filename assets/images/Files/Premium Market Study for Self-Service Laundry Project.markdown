## **1. Executive Summary**
The self-service laundry project in Algerian university dormitories addresses a critical need for affordable, convenient, and modern laundry solutions among students. With Algeria’s student population projected to reach 1.874 million by 2025, and over 600,000 residing in dormitories, the demand for efficient laundry services is substantial. This market study reveals a significant opportunity for a self-service model that leverages technology, affordability, and sustainability to differentiate from traditional off-campus laundries and manual washing methods.

Key findings include:
- **High Demand**: 80% of students express dissatisfaction with current laundry options, citing high costs, limited access, and time constraints.
- **Competitive Edge**: The project’s on-site accessibility, 24/7 availability, and pricing at 75 DZD per wash position it as a superior alternative to off-campus services (200-300 DZD per load).
- **Financial Viability**: With an initial investment of 260,000 EUR for 10 sites, the project is expected to generate monthly revenues of 1,125 EUR per site, achieving ROI in approximately 2.6 years.
- **Strategic Partnerships**: Collaboration with Condor Electronics for equipment supply and the Algerian Ministry of Higher Education for institutional support will enhance feasibility and credibility.

This study provides a roadmap for launching and scaling the project, ensuring it meets the needs of students while delivering strong financial returns and social impact.
